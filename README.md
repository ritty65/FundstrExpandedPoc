## ‚ú®  What is it?

Schedule‚ÄØCashu‚ÄØDonation lets anyone **pledge a daily, weekly, or monthly amount** to their favourite Nostr creators without trusting a custodial wallet or keeping their browser online.

* The **donor** creates a pledge in the web UI.
* A headless **scheduler service** queues the job and, at the allotted moment, delivers a **Cashu** token to the creator via an encrypted Nostr DM.
* The money moves automatically, the keys remain yours, and the scheduler never learns the token‚Äôs secret or controls your keys.

Think "Patreon meets Lightning" ‚Äî but decentralised, censorship‚Äëresistant, and self‚Äëhostable.

```
packages/
  scheduler-core/      # Protocol helpers, validation, signing
  scheduler-service/   # Node daemon that watches relays and executes tasks
  web-ui/              # React + Vite donation wizard

Each sub‚Äëfolder is an independent npm package managed through **pnpm workspaces**.

## üîç  How it works (10‚Äësecond tour)

| Step | Actor         | What happens                                                                                                                                           |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Donor UI**  | Builds a `pledge_instruction` event (NIP‚Äë52 replaceable) containing: amount, recurrence rule (`RRULE:`), creator‚Äôs npub, and an encrypted Cashu token. |
| 2    | **Scheduler** | Subscribes to relays for events that tag its pubkey. It decrypts, validates, and stores each pledge in a DB queue.                                     |
| 3    | **Delivery**  | When the cron rule fires, the service signs the prepared DM with a delegated key and publishes it to the relays.                                       |
| 4    | **Creator**   | Their client decrypts the DM, redeems the Cashu token, and automatically thanks the donor (optional webhook).                                          |

More technical detail lives in [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

## üöÄ  Quick start (local dev)

```bash
# prerequisites: Node ‚â• 20, pnpm ‚â• 9, git

git clone https://github.com/yourname/schedule-cashu-donation.git
cd schedule-cashu-donation
corepack enable            # enables pnpm
pnpm install               # installs all workspace deps

# start the database (SQLite by default)
# for Postgres: cp .env.example .env and edit

# run the scheduler in watch‚Äëmode with an in‚Äëmemory queue
pnpm --filter scheduler-service dev

# open the donation wizard in another terminal
pnpm --filter web-ui dev
```

Point your Nostr client at the same relays listed in `web-ui/src/config/relays.ts`, create a pledge, and watch the scheduler log as it delivers test tokens.

## üê≥  Run in Docker

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t cashu/scheduler:latest .
docker run -d --name scheduler \
  -e DB_URL="postgres://user:pass@db:5432/scheduler" \
  -v scheduler-data:/var/lib/scheduler \
  cashu/scheduler:latest
```

Combine with **docker‚Äëcompose** for Postgres, Prometheus, and Grafana (see [`docker/docker-compose.yml`](docker/docker-compose.yml)).
